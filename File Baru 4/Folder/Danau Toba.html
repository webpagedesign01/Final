<br><h2>Lake Toba</h2> is a large natural lake in 
    North Sumatra, Indonesia, occupying the caldera of a supervolcano. The lake is located in the middle of 
    the northern part of the island of Sumatra, with a surface elevation of about 900 metres (2,953 ft), the 
    lake stretches from 2.88°N 98.52°E to 2.35°N 99.1°E. The lake is about 100 kilometres (62 miles) long, 30 
    kilometres (19 mi) wide, and up to 505 metres (1,657 ft) deep. It is the largest lake in Indonesia and 
    the largest volcanic lake in the world. Toba Caldera is one of twenty geoparks in Indonesia, and was 
    recognised in July 2020 as one of the UNESCO Global Geoparks. Lake Toba is the site of a supervolcanic 
    eruption estimated at VEI 8 that occurred 69,000 to 77,000 years ago, representing a climate-changing 
    event. Recent advances in dating methods suggest a more accurate identification of 74,000 years ago as 
    the date. It is the largest-known explosive eruption on Earth in the last 25 million years. 
    <br><br>
    According to the Toba catastrophe theory, it had global consequences for human populations; it killed 
    most humans living at that time and is believed to have created a population bottleneck in central east 
    Africa and India, which affects the genetic make-up of the human worldwide population to the present. 
    More recent studies have cast doubt on this theory and found no evidence of substantial changes in global 
    population. 
    <br>It has been accepted that the eruption of the Toba Caldera led to a volcanic winter with a worldwide 
    decrease in temperature between 3 and 5 °C (5.4 and 9.0 °F), and up to 15 °C (27 °F) in higher latitudes. 
    Additional studies in Lake Malawi in East Africa show significant amounts of ash being deposited from the 
    Toba Caldera eruptions, even at that great distance, but little indication of a significant climatic 
    effect in East Africa.
    <br><br><h2>Geology</h2>
    <br>The Toba Caldera in North Sumatra comprises four overlapping volcanic craters that adjoin the Sumatran
    "volcanic front". At 100 by 30 kilometres (62 by 19 mi) it is the world's largest Quaternary caldera, 
    and the fourth and youngest caldera. It intersects the three older calderas. An estimated 2,800 km3 
    (670 cu mi) of dense-rock equivalent pyroclastic material, known as the youngest Toba tuff, was released 
    during one of the largest explosive volcanic eruptions in recent geological history.[13] Following this 
    eruption, a resurgent dome formed within the new caldera, joining two half-domes separated by a 
    longitudinal graben.
    <br>
    At least four cones, four stratovolcanoes, and three craters are visible in the lake. The Tandukbenua 
    cone on the northwestern edge of the caldera has only sparse vegetation, suggesting a young age of 
    several hundred years. Also, the Pusubukit (Hill Center) volcano (1,971 m (6,467 ft) above sea level) on 
    the south edge of the caldera is solfatarically active.
    <br><br><h2>Major Eruption</h2>
    <br>The Toba eruption (the Toba event) occurred at what is now Lake Toba about 73,700±300 years ago. 
    It was the last in a series of at least four caldera-forming eruptions at this location, with the earlier 
    known caldera having formed around 1.2 million years ago.[16] This last eruption had an estimated VEI=8, 
    making it the largest-known explosive volcanic eruption in the Quaternary.
    Bill Rose and Craig Chesner of Michigan Technological University have estimated that the total amount of 
    material released in the eruption was at least 2,800 km3 (670 cu mi)[17]—about 2,000 km3 (480 cu mi) of 
    ignimbrite that flowed over the ground, and approximately 800 km3 (190 cu mi) that fell as ash mostly to 
    the west. However, as more outcrops become available, Toba possibly erupted 3,200 km3 (770 cu mi) of 
    ignimbrite and co-ignimbrite. The pyroclastic flows of the eruption destroyed an area of least 20,000 km2 
    (7,700 sq mi), with ash deposits as thick as 600 m (2,000 ft) by the main vent.[17] The eruption was 
    large enough to have deposited an ash layer approximately 15 cm (6 in) thick over all of South Asia; at 
    one site in central India, the Toba ash layer today is up to 6 m (20 ft) thick[18] and parts of Malaysia 
    were covered with 9 m (30 ft) of ash fall. 
    The subsequent collapse formed a caldera that filled with water, creating Lake Toba. The island in the 
    center of the lake is formed by a resurgent dome. 
    <br>The exact year of the eruption is unknown, but the pattern of ash deposits suggests that it occurred 
    during the northern summer because only the summer monsoon could have deposited Toba ashfall in the South 
    China Sea.[20] The eruption lasted perhaps two weeks, and the ensuing volcanic winter resulted in a 
    decrease in average global temperatures by 3.0 to 3.5 °C (5 to 6 °F) for several years. Ice cores from 
    Greenland record a pulse of starkly reduced levels of organic carbon sequestration. Very few plants or 
    animals in southeast Asia would have survived, and it is possible that the eruption caused a planet-wide 
    die-off. However, the global cooling has been discussed by Rampino and Self. Their conclusion is that the 
    cooling had already started before Toba's eruption. This conclusion was supported by Lane and Zielinski 
    who studied the lake-core from Africa and GISP2. They concluded that there was no volcanic winter after 
    the Toba eruption and that high H2SO4 deposits do not cause long-term effects.[21][22] Furthermore, due 
    to the low solubility of sulfur in the magma, the emission of volatiles and climate impacts are likely 
    limited.
    <br>
    Evidence from studies of mitochondrial DNA suggests that humans may have passed through a genetic 
    bottleneck around this time that reduced genetic diversity below what would be expected given the age of 
    the species. According to the Toba catastrophe theory, proposed by Stanley H. Ambrose of the University 
    of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in 1998, the effects of the Toba eruption may have decreased the size of 
    human populations to only a few tens of thousands of individuals.[24] However, this hypothesis is not 
    widely accepted because similar effects on other animal species have not been observed, and 
    paleoanthropology suggests there was no population bottleneck.[25][26] The genetic bottleneck is now 
    recognized to be the Out-of-Africa founder effect, rather than an actual reduction in population.

    <br><h2>People</h2>
    <br>Most of the people who live around Lake Toba are ethnically Bataks. Traditional Batak houses are 
    noted for their distinctive roofs (which curve upwards at each end, as a boat's hull does) and their 
    colorful decor.
    <br><br><h2>Transportation</h2>
    <br>Parapat is located on the edge of the lake, which is the transit point to travel the lake and Samosir 
    Island. Medan is about 173 km by road from the town and is connected via the Trans-Sumatran Highway to 
    Pematang Siantar by a 48 km road. Sisingamangaraja XII International Airport is located about 47 mi 
    (76 km) from Parapat
    <br><br><h2>Flora and Fauna</h2>
    <br>The flora of the lake includes various types of phytoplankton, emerged macrophytes, floating 
    macrophytes, and submerged macrophytes, while the surrounding countryside is rainforest including 
    areas of Sumatran tropical pine forests on the higher mountainsides.
    <br>
    The fauna includes several species of zooplankton and benthic animals. Since the lake is oligotrophic 
    (nutrient-poor), the native fish fauna is relatively scarce, and the only endemics are Rasbora tobana 
    (strictly speaking near-endemic, since also found in some tributary rivers that run into the lake) 
    and Neolissochilus thienemanni, locally known as the Batak fish.[35] The latter species is threatened by 
    deforestation (causing siltation), pollution, changes in water level and the numerous fish species that 
    have been introduced to the lake.[35] Other native fishes include species such as Aplocheilus panchax, 
    Nemacheilus pfeifferae, Homaloptera gymnogaster, Channa gachua, Channa striata, Clarias batrachus, 
    Barbonymus gonionotus, Barbonymus schwanenfeldii, Danio albolineatus, Osteochilus vittatus, Puntius 
    binotatus, Rasbora jacobsoni, Tor tambra, Betta imbellis, Betta taeniata and Monopterus albus. 
    Among the many introduced species are Anabas testudineus, Oreochromis mossambicus, Oreochromis niloticus, 
    Ctenopharyngodon idella, Cyprinus carpio, Osphronemus goramy, Trichogaster pectoralis, Trichopodus 
    trichopterus, Poecilia reticulata and Xiphophorus hellerii.
    <br><br><h2>In Popular Culture</h2>
    <br>The Origin of Lake Toba is a folk story about the lake, in which once upon a time, there was a 
    fisherman who caught a golden fish. Samosir Island is believed to be the golden fish's son.
