    <h2>BOROBUDUR TEMPLE HISTORY</h2>
    <p><br>Borobudur (Indonesian: Candi Borobudur, Javanese: ꦕꦤ꧀ꦝꦶꦧꦫꦧꦸꦝꦸꦂ, romanized: 
      Candhi Barabudhur) is a 9th-century Mahayana Buddhist temple in Magelang Regency, not far from the city 
      of Magelang and the town of Muntilan, in Central Java, Indonesia. It is the world's largest Buddhist 
      temple. The temple consists of nine stacked platforms, six square and three circular, 
      topped by a central dome. It is decorated with 2,672 relief panels and originally 504 Buddha statues. 
      The central dome is surrounded by 72 Buddha statues, each seated inside a perforated stupa.

      <br>Built between 778 and 850 AD during the reign of the Sailendra Dynasty, the temple design follows 
      Javanese Buddhist architecture, which blends the Indonesian indigenous tradition of ancestor worship 
      and the Buddhist concept of attaining nirvāṇa. The temple demonstrates the influences of Gupta art 
      that reflects India's influence on the region, yet there are enough indigenous scenes and elements 
      incorporated to make Borobudur uniquely Indonesian. The monument is a shrine to the Buddha and a 
      place for Buddhist pilgrimage. The pilgrim journey begins at the base of the monument and follows a 
      path around the monument, ascending to the top through three levels symbolic of Buddhist cosmology: 
      Kāmadhātu (the world of desire), Rūpadhātu (the world of forms) and Arūpadhātu (the world of 
      formlessness). The monument guides pilgrims through an extensive system of stairways and corridors with 
      1,460 narrative relief panels on the walls and the balustrades. 
      Borobudur has one of the largest and most complete ensembles of Buddhist reliefs in the world.
     
      <br>Evidence suggests that Borobudur was constructed in the 8th century and subsequently abandoned 
      following the 14th-century decline of Hindu kingdoms in Java and the Javanese conversion to Islam.
      Worldwide knowledge of its existence was sparked in 1814 by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, then the 
      British ruler of Java, who was advised of its location by native Indonesians. Borobudur has since 
      been preserved through several restorations. The largest restoration project (The second restoration 
      project of Borobudur) was completed at 1983 by the Indonesian government and UNESCO, followed by the 
      monument's listing as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
      <br>Borobudur is the largest Buddhist temple in the world, and ranks with Bagan in Myanmar and Angkor Wat 
      in Cambodia as one of the great archeological sites of Southeast Asia. Borobudur remains popular for 
      pilgrimage, with Buddhists in Indonesia celebrating Vesak Day at the monument. Borobudur is Indonesia's 
      single most visited tourist attraction.

      <br>Borobudur Temple viewed from the northwest. The monument was mentioned in the Karangtengah and Tri Tepusan inscriptions.
      In Indonesian, ancient temples are referred to as candi; thus locals refer to "Borobudur Temple" as 
      Candi Borobudur. The term candi also loosely describes ancient structures, for example, gates and baths. The origins of name Borobudur, is derived from Boro for big and Budur for Buddha.[14] The name Borobudur was first written in Raffles's book on Javan history.[15] Raffles wrote about a monument called Borobudur, but there are no older documents suggesting the same name.[14] The only old Javanese manuscript that hints the monument called Budur as a holy Buddhist sanctuary is Nagarakretagama, written by Mpu Prapanca, a Buddhist scholar of Majapahit court, in 1365.[16] Most candi are named after a nearby village. If it followed Javanese language conventions and was named after the nearby village of Bore, the monument should have been named "BudurBoro". Raffles thought that Budur might correspond to the modern Javanese word Buda ("ancient")—i.e., "ancient Boro". He also suggested that the name might derive from boro, meaning "great" or "honorable" and Budur for Buddha.[14] However, another archaeologist suggests the second component of the name (Budur) comes from Javanese term bhudhara ("mountain").[17]
      <br>
      Another possible etymology by Dutch archaeologist A.J. Bernet Kempers suggests that Borobudur is a 
      corrupted simplified local Javanese pronunciation of Biara Beduhur written in Sanskrit as 
      Vihara Buddha Uhr. The term Buddha-Uhr could mean "the city of Buddhas", while another possible term
      Beduhur is probably an Old Javanese term, still survived today in Balinese vocabulary, which means "a 
      high place", constructed from the stem word dhuhur or luhur (high). This suggests that Borobudur means 
      vihara of Buddha located on a high place or on a hill.
      <br>
      The construction and inauguration of a sacred Buddhist building—possibly a reference to 
      Borobudur was mentioned in two inscriptions, both discovered in Kedu, Temanggung Regency. 
      The Karangtengah inscription, dated 824, mentioned a sacred building named Jinalaya 
      (the realm of those who have conquered worldly desire and reached enlightenment), inaugurated by 
      Pramodhawardhani, daughter of Samaratungga. The Tri Tepusan inscription, dated 842, is mentioned in the 
      sima, the (tax free) lands awarded by Çrī Kahulunnan (Pramodhawardhani) to ensure the funding and 
      maintenance of a Kamūlān called Bhūmisambhāra.[19] Kamūlān is from the word mula, which means "the place 
      of origin", a sacred building to honor the ancestors, probably those of the Sailendras. Casparis 
      suggested that Bhūmi Sambhāra Bhudhāra, which in Sanskrit means "the mountain of combined virtues of the 
      ten stages of Boddhisattvahood", was the original name of Borobudur.[20] Additionally, the term 
      Borobudur is possibly derived from the Sanskrit term परमबुद्ध which mean Parama Buddha or Supreme Buddha.[</p>
