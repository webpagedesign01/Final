          <br><h2>Bromo Mountain</h2> (Indonesian: Taman Nasional Bromo Tengger Semeru; abbreviated as 
          TNBTS) is a national park located in East Java, Indonesia, to the east of Malang and Lumajang, to the 
          south of Pasuruan and Probolinggo, and to the southeast of Surabaya, the capital of East Java. It is the 
          only conservation area in Indonesia that has a sand sea, the Tengger Sand Sea (Indonesian: Laut 
          Pasir Tengger), across which is the caldera of an ancient volcano (Tengger) from which four new 
          volcanic cones have emerged. This unique feature covers a total area of 5,250 hectares at an 
          altitude of about 2,100 meters (6,900 ft). The massif also contains the highest mountain in Java,
          Mount Semeru (3,676 meters (12,060 ft)), four lakes and 50 rivers. It is named after the Tengger 
          tribe. The explosion of the volcano that created the caldera, happened ca. 45.000 years ago, in an 
          event similar to the Krakatau eruption.
          The Tengger Sand Sea has been protected since 1919. The Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park was 
          declared a national park in 1982.
          <br><br><h2>Tengger Massif</h2>  
          <br>The Tengger massif is a massif within the park. The area is an active volcanic complex 
          surrounded by a plain of sand.
          <br><br><h2>Volcanism</h2>
          <br>The volcanic complex of Tengger forms a condition where a new caldera of volcano forms inside a 
          larger and more ancient caldera. There are five volcanoes inside the Tengger Caldera: Mount Bromo 
          (2,329 m), Mount Batok (2,470 m), Mount Kursi (2,581 m), Mount Watangan (2,661 m), and Mount 
          Widodaren (2,650 m). Mount Batok is the only peak that is no longer active, and is covered in 
          casuarina (Indonesian: cemara) trees. Mount Widodaren, located beside Mount Batok, contains the 
          cave Widodaren, which is considered sacred by local people.
          
          <br>The five volcanoes within the caldera are surrounded by a vast area of sand called the 
          Tengger Sand Sea, which in turn is surrounded by a steep crater wall of the larger Tengger Caldera 
          with height differences of about 200–600 meters (660–1,970 ft). Other mountains around the Tengger 
          caldera are: Mount Pananjakan (2,770 m), Mount Cemorolawang (2,227 m), Mount Lingker (2,278 m), 
          Mount Pundak Lembu (2,635 m), Mount Jantur (2,705 m), Mount Ider-ider (2,527 m) and Mount Mungal 
          (2,480 m). The peak of Mount Pananjakan is the most popular place to watch the entire volcanic 
          complex of Tengger.
          <br>Further south in the national park, there is another volcanic complex called the Semeru Group 
          or Jambangan Group. This area contains the highest peak of Java, Mount Semeru (3,676 m). 
          Other mountains within this area are Mount Lanang (2,313 m), Mount Ayek-ayek (2,819 m), 
          Mount Pangonan Cilik (2,833 m), Mount Keduwung (2,334 m), Mount Jambangan (3,020 m), Mount Gentong 
          (1,951 m), Mount Kepolo (3,035 m), and Mount Malang (2,401 m). The Semeru forest area has many 
          rivers that are former lava lines from Mount Semeru. The Semeru group is considered to be very 
          productive, producing volcanic matters such as lava, volcanic ash, and hot cloud and spreading it 
          to the surrounding area. The lower area is surrounded with fertile rice fields.

          <br><br><h2>Climate</h2>
          <br>The climate in Bromo Tengger Semeru is cold, especially in winter from May until September. 
          There is heavy rainfall in summer, while there is little to no precipitation in winter. Nighttime 
          temperatures in winter commonly fall below zero degrees Celsius, with potential for frost and light 
          snow. It is classified as a subtropical highland.
          <br><br><h2>Flora and Fauna</h2>
          <br>There is a relatively small diversity of fauna in the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park. 
          There are about 137 species of birds, 22 species of mammals and 4 species of reptiles protected in 
          the national park. Examples are besra, green peafowl, Javan rusa, Sumatran dhole, crab-eating 
          macaque, marbled cat and Javan leopard
          <br><br><h2>Culture</h2> 
          <br>The area in and around the park is inhabited by the Tengger people, one of the few significant 
          Hindu communities remaining on the island of Java. Their population of roughly 600,000 is centered 
          in thirty villages in the isolated Tengger mountains including Mount Bromo and areas within the 
          park. The local religion is a remnant from the Majapahit era and therefore quite similar to that 
          on Bali but with even more animist elements. The Tengger people are believed to be descendants of 
          the Majapahit empire and were driven into the hills after mass arrival in the area of Muslim 
          Madurese in the 19th century.
