  <br><h2>Gado-Gado</h2>, the famous Indonesian salad, is an Indonesian version of a mixed salad. It usually consists of a variety of vegetables, eggs, 
  tempeh, and tofu. The vegetables are usually just slightly boiled, tossed with a nut completed with the addition of crispy prawn crackers.
  <br><br><h2>Peanut Dressing Ingredients</h2>
    <br>Most of flavours in gado-gado are acquired from the mixture of its bumbu kacang or peanut salad 
    dressing. Gado-gado combines slightly sweet, spicy and savory tastes.The common primary ingredients 
    of the peanut sauce are as follows:
    <br>ground fried peanuts (kidney beans may be substituted for a richer taste),coconut sugar/palm sugar 
    (substitute brown sugar if unavailable), chillies (according to preference and desired degree of spiciness), 
    terasi (dried shrimp paste), salt, tamarind juice, lime juice, water to dilute.
    <br>The traditional method of making gado-gado is to use the cobek (pestle) and ulekan or flat rounded 
    stone. The dry ingredients are ground first, then the tamarind liquids are added to achieve the desired consistency.
    <br><br><h2>Vegetables</h2>
    <br>The composition of the vegetable salad varies greatly, but usually comprises a mixture of some of the 
    following: blanched - shredded, chopped, or sliced green vegetables such as cabbage, kangkung, spinach, 
    bean sprouts, boiled young jack fruit, chayote, string bean, green bean, bitter melon, and corn, sliced - 
    boiled potatoes, uncooked - sliced cucumber, tomato, and lettuce, peeled and sliced boiled eggs sliced - 
    fried tofu and tempeh.
    Outside Indonesia, it is usual to improvise with whatever vegetables are available. 
    All the ingredients are blanched or lightly boiled, including vegetables, potatoes and bean sprouts, 
    except for the tempeh and tofu, which are fried, and cucumber which is sliced and served fresh. 
    The blanched vegetables and other ingredients are mixed well with the dressing.
    <br><br><h2>Garnishes and Rice</h2> 
    <br>In Indonesia gado-gado is commonly served mixed with chopped lontong or ketupat (glutinous rice cake), 
    or with steamed rice served separately. It is nearly always served with krupuk, e.g. tapioca crackers or 
    emping, Indonesian style fried crackers, which are made from melinjo. A common garnish is bawang goreng, 
    a sprinkle of finely-chopped fried shallot.
    <br><br><h2>Serving</h2>
    <br>There are three common ways of serving the gado-gado dish in Indonesia. Firstly, 
    gado-gado is sometimes prepared at home as a traditional Indonesian dish. It is relatively easy 
    to prepare and cook, which is part of the reason why gado-gado can be commonly found in Indonesian 
    households. Secondly, some street vendors and warungs in Indonesia are known to sell gado-gado. 
    However, different cities may serve different variations of gado-gado depending on the region. Thirdly, 
    gado-gado can also be found in restaurants that serve Indonesian cuisine. Amongst many Indonesian 
    restaurants, gado-gado is a relatively common dish, because it is popular in Indonesia.</div>
