<br><h2>Rendang</h2> is a Minangkabau dish. It is a rich meat dish that 
has been slow cooked and braised in a coconut milk seasoned with a herb and spice mixture over a period of 
several hours until the liquids evaporate and the meat turns dark brown and tender, becoming caramelized and 
infused with rich flavours.
<br>It originated from the Minangkabau region in West Sumatra, Indonesia. It has spread across Indonesian 
cuisine to the cuisines of neighbouring Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and the 
Philippines. As the signature dish of Minangkabau culture, rendang is traditionally served at ceremonial 
occasions to honour guests during festive events; such as wedding feasts and Lebaran (Indonesian popular words
for both Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha). Rendang is also traditionally served among the Malay community in 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, as well as the Maranao in the Philippines.
</p>

<br>Rendang is officially recognised as one of Indonesia's national dishes. Six types of rendang preparations 
have also been designated as intangible cultural heritage by the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture. 
A broad survey in 2011 placed beef rendang as the most delicious dish in the world.

<p><br><h2>History</h2>
<br>The origin of rendang could be traced back to the Indian merchants links to West Sumatra before the 15th 
century. There are Dutch archives about Minangkabau that state regular contacts between India and West Sumatra
in the early second millennium, thus suggests that north Indian curry was possibly the precursor of rendang. 
Indian curry was adopted by the Minangkabau people as gulai, a local version of curry. Minangkabau people 
then cooked this gulai further in order to prepare kalio also known as wet rendang. This cooking process was 
then continued until it thickened and became rendang or also known as dry rendang.
<br>Andalas University historian, Prof. Gusti Asnan suggests that rendang began to spread across the region 
when Minangkabau merchants began to trade and migrate to Malacca in the 16th century, "Because the journey 
through the river waterways in Sumatra took much time, a durable preserved dry rendang is suitable for a long 
journey. The dried Padang rendang is a durable food, good to consume for weeks, even when left at room 
temperature. One of the earliest written records of rendang is from the Malaccan Malay manuscript of 
Hikayat Amir Hamzah, Rendang originated in the Sumatran Minangkabau region and the making of rendang 
spreads from Minangkabau highlands to Mandailing, Riau, Jambi, across the strait to Malacca and Negeri 
Sembilan, resulting in a variety of rendang traditions.

<p>During Indonesian National Revolution in 1946, Indonesian first lady Fatmawati, the wife of Sukarno cooked 
and sent rendang to boost morale of Indonesian republic freedom fighters around Yogyakarta. Declined by 
household helps, she insisted on buying beef and went to the market herself by becak despite being pregnant 
at that time.
<br>The popularity of rendang has spread widely from its original domain because of the merantau (migrating) 
culture of Minangkabau people. In the modern era, Overseas Minangkabau leave their hometown to start a career 
in other Indonesian cities as well as neighboring countries, and Padang restaurants, Minangkabau eating 
establishments that are ubiquitous in Indonesian cities, spring up. These Padang restaurants have introduced 
and popularised Minangkabau style rendang and other Padang food dishes across Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, 
and the wider world.

<p><br><h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
<br>Rendang is revered in Minangkabau culture as an embodiment of the philosophy of musyawarah, discussion 
and consultation with elders. It has been claimed that the four main ingredients represent Minangkabau 
society as a whole:
<br><h2>The meat</h2><mark>(Daging)</mark> symbolises the Niniak Mamak, the traditional clan leaders such as the datuk, the nobles,
royalty and revered elders.
<br><h2>The coconut milk</h2><mark>(Karambia)</mark> symbolises the Cadiak Pandai, intellectuals, teachers, poets and writers.
<br><h2>The chilli</h2><mark>(Lado)</mark> symbolises the Alim Ulama, clerics, ulama and religious leaders. The hotness of the chilli symbolises Sharia.
<br><h2>The spice mixture</h2><mark>(Pemasak)</mark> symbolises the rest of Minangkabau society.
<br>In Minangkabau tradition, rendang is a requisite dish for special occasions in traditional Minang 
ceremonies, from birth ceremonies to circumcision, marriage, Qur'an recitals, and religious festivals such as 
Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha.
<br><br><h2>In 2011</h2> Rendang placed 11th place on a list of World's 50 best foods published by CNN International.
An online reader's poll of 35,000 voters chose beef rendang as the top dish on CNN International's Readers' 
picks list.
<br>The Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture have included six rendang preparations under its 
National Intangible Cultural Heritage of Indonesia list, all of which are registered under West Sumatra: 
Randang (Minang spelling), and gulai rendang, were part of the inaugural list in 2010. They were 
joined by randang daging (meat rendang), randang kantang (potato rendang), and randang incek kacang,
in 2016. Rendang paku (fern rendang) of Dharmasraya, is the most recent addition as of 2018.

<div><br><h2>Composition and Cooking Method</h2>
<br>Rendang is most often described as meat slow-cooked in coconut milk and spices until it becomes tender.
If cooked properly, dry rendang can last for as long as four weeks. Prior to refrigeration technology, 
this style of cooking enabled preservation of the large amount of meat. The cooking technique flourished 
because of its role in preserving meat in a tropical climate. Its durability is one of the reasons that 
today, prepackaged rendang is sent as food aid relief for natural disaster survivors in Indonesia. 
The cut of beef suitable for rendang is lean meat of the rear leg of the cattle; i.e. topside or round beef, 
which is considered perfect for slow cooking.
<br><br>Rendang is rich in spices. Along with the main meat ingredient, rendang uses coconut milk and a paste of 
mixed ground spices, including ginger, galangal, turmeric leaves, lemongrass, garlic, shallots, chillis and 
other spices. This spice mixture is called pemasak in Minangkabau. The spices, garlic, shallot, ginger and 
galangal used in rendang have antimicrobial properties and serve as natural organic preservatives. 
Although some culinary experts describe rendang as a curry, the dish is usually not considered as 
such in Indonesia or Malaysia since it is richer and contains less liquid than is normal for curries.
<br><br>Traditionally the term rendang does not refer to a certain type of dish. The verb merendang actually 
refers to a method of slow cooking; continuously churning the ingredients in a pot or frying pan, on a small 
fire, until all of the liquids evaporate and the meat is well done. Traditional Padang rendang takes 
hours to cook. Cooking rendang involves pounding and grinding ingredients as well as slow cooking, and so is 
time-consuming and requires patience. The meat pieces are slowly cooked in coconut milk and spices until 
almost all the liquid is gone, allowing the meat to become tender and absorb the condiments. The cooking 
process changes from boiling to frying, as the liquid evaporates and the coconut milk turns to coconut oil.
Cooking the meat until tender with almost all the liquid evaporated requires great care, keeping it from 
getting burnt. Because of its generous use of numerous spices, rendang is known for having a complex and 
unique taste.</div>
