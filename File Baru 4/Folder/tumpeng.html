  <br><h2>Tumpeng</h2> (Javanese: ꦠꦸꦩ꧀ꦥꦼꦁ) is an Indonesian cone-shaped rice dish with side dishes of 
vegetables and meat originating from Javanese cuisine of Indonesia. Traditionally featured in the slamatan 
ceremony, the rice is made by using a cone-shaped woven bamboo container. The rice itself may be plain 
steamed rice, uduk rice (cooked with coconut milk), or yellow rice (uduk rice colored with kunyit (turmeric)).
The rice cone is erected in the tampah (rounded woven bamboo container), covered with a banana leaf, and 
surrounded by assorted Indonesian dishes. In 2013, the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy 
promoted tumpeng as one of 30 Indonesian culinary icons and gave it the status of official national dish of 
Indonesia in 2014, describing it as "the dish that binds the diversity of Indonesian various culinary 
traditions.
<br><br><h2>History and Tradition</h2>
<br>People in Java, Bali and Madura usually make tumpeng to celebrate important events. However, all 
Indonesians are familiar with tumpeng. The philosophy of tumpeng is related to the geographical condition of 
Indonesia, especially Java as fertile island with numerous mountains and volcanos. Tumpeng dates back to 
ancient Indonesian tradition that revered mountains as the abode of hyangs, the spirit of ancestors and gods. 
The cone-shaped rice represents the holy mountain. The feast served as a thanksgiving for the abundance of 
harvest or any other blessings.[citation needed]. Tumpeng is a symbol of gratitude,[1] in gratitude ceremony 
(syukuran or slametan), after the people pray, the top of tumpeng is cut and delivered to the most important 
person. He or she may be the group leader, the oldest person, or the beloved one. 
Then, all people in the ceremony enjoy the tumpeng together. With tumpeng, people express the gratitude 
to God and appreciate togetherness and harmony. An annual ceremony involving tumpeng is commonly called 
'tumpengan'. Tumpengs and gunungans are an essential part in the Javanese festival sekaten. 
In Surakarta and Yogyakarta, huge and large amount of tumpengs are included in a big traditional parade from 
the palace to the grand mosque. They are prayed upon in the grand mosque, and then distributed to the people 
as part of the festivities celebrating the birth of the prophet Muhammad.
In modern times, the top of the tumpeng is given to an honoured guest in social events, ceremonies or awards. 
In many Indonesian cities, such as Yogyakarta, a tradition has been developed — the tumpengan ceremony the 
eve of 17 August — which is Indonesian independence day. The event is meant to pray for safety and welfare of 
the nation.
<br><br><h2>Surrounding Dishes</h2> 
<br>The cone-shaped rice is surrounded by assorted Indonesian dishes, such as urap vegetables, ayam goreng 
(fried chicken), ayam bakar (grilled chicken), empal gepuk (sweet and spicy fried beef), abon sapi 
(beef floss), semur (beef stew in sweet soy sauce), teri kacang (anchovy with peanuts), fried prawn, 
telur pindang (boiled marble egg), shredded omelette, tempe orek (sweet and dry fried tempeh), perkedel 
kentang (mashed potato fritters), perkedel jagung (corn fritters), sambal goreng ati (liver in chilli sauce), 
sliced cucumbers and many other things. Traditionally there should be a balance between vegetables, egg, 
meat, and seafood. The composition of a traditional Javanese tumpeng is more complex because the elements 
must balance one another according to Javanese belief. Traditional Javanese tumpeng usually involves urap 
vegetables, tempeh, ayam goreng, teri kacang, fried shrimp, telur pindang, empal gepuk and sambal. 
After the adoption of tumpeng as the national dish, tumpeng is expected to be a dish that binds Indonesia's 
cooking traditions. Its side dishes might be popular Indonesian dishes, such as gado-gado, satay and rendang. 
Today the dishes which accompany tumpeng can be of the host's discretion.

<br><br><h2>Philossophical Meaning</h2>
<br>There is a philosophical meaning on every part of traditional tumpeng. According to folklore in Java and 
Bali, the cone-shaped tumpeng is a mystic symbol of life and ecosystems. It also symbolizes the glory of God 
as the Creator of nature, and the side dishes and vegetables represent the life and harmony of nature. 
The authentic and complete tumpeng dishes should contain at least one meat to represent a land animal, 
fish to represent sea creatures, an egg to represent winged beasts, and vegetables that represent a food 
stock provided by the plant kingdom. Usually tumpeng is served with spinach as spinach is a traditional 
symbol of prosperity in Javanese agricultural society.
<br><br>Here are the philosophical meanings behind some of the ingredients in tumpeng:
<br><h2>Egg</h2>The egg is served with the shell still on. Peeling the egg before eating it symbolizes everything a 
person has to plan and do before becoming a good person.
<br><h2>Vegetables</h2>A wrap of vegetables represents a good relationship with friends and neighbors. 
Spinach represents a safe and peaceful life; water spinach represents a person who could live through 
hardships; string beans represent a long life; and mungbean sprouts represent carrying ancestors' legacy.
<br><h2>Catfish</h2>Catfish represents the importance of preparing for troubles in the future. It also represents 
being humble, since catfish live on the bottom of ponds.
<br><h2>Milkfish</h2>The many bones of the milkfish represent good fortune and prosperity in the future.
<br><h2>Anchovies</h2>Because they live together, the anchovies represent having a good relationship with family and neighbors.
